        <p>AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture (AUTOSAR) is developed by <i>automobile manufacturers and vendors,
            suppliers, service providers and companies from automotive electronics, semiconductor and software</i>
          together
          in order to standardize the development of vehicle software. Before AUTOSAR every manufacturer and vendors
          used to create their own version of software and its features, interfaces were not compatible with each other.
          With standardization of the architecture and the interfaces each vendor, manufacturer can develop, integrate
          the sub-systems, and build on top of each others works without much thinking of compatibility. Modifications,
          upgrade and update becomes easy. It targets increased reuse and exchangibility of SW modules between OEMs and
          suppliers.
        </p>
        <p>Before AUTOSAR, traditional approach,
          <code>
          <br>[- Application Software -]
          <br>[------- Software -------]
          <br>[------- Hardware -------]
        </code>
        <p>After AUTOSAR
          <code>
            <br>[--- Application Software --]
            <br>[- Standardized Middleware -]
            <br>[-- Standardized Basic SW --]
            <br>[---- Hardware Specific ----]
            <br>[-------- Hardware ---------]
          </code>
        <p>Thus benefits,
        <ul>
          <li>HW and SW - widely independent of each other</li>
          <li>Development can be decoupled, so reduced time and costs</li>
          <li>Reuse of SW, enhanced quality and efficiency</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
