                I'm a Senior Architect in Cognizant Technologies, in <a href="https://www.cognizant.com/banking-financial-technology-solutions/investment-banking-brokerage" target="_blank">Banking and Finance domain</a>.
                Here is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prashantsg" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> profile.
                Last 5 years particularly have been indulged in designing and developing the Low Latency applications using Modern C++ on Unix based Operating Systems.

                <p>
                With total IT experience of almost 17 years, I started as a C/C++ programmer for a small company, <a href="http://cyspl.com/" target="_blank">CygNET systems pvt ltd</a>.
                Then shifted to work with few Indian IT giants like <a href="https://www.wipro.com/" target="_blank">Wipro</a>, Symphony (Now <a href="https://www.harman.com/india" target="_blank">Harman</a>), Aztechsoft (now <a href="https://www.mindtree.com/" target="_blank">Mindtree</a> ), where the projects I worked on were in writing Network protocols, Device Drivers, C++ Applications with JNI and few cross platform applications too.
                At <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivoli_Software">IBM (ISL) in Tivoli Technolgies</a> the experience was a lot different, where exposure to different domains like Vitualization, Enpoint Management, Provisioning systems, and also the exposur to differnt technologies like J2EE, BigFix are a few of the new worlds for me and honestly I did not do well with the opportunities I got there.
                </p>
                <p>
                However, after I joined Cognizant Technologies where I returned to my core competency of C++, I came to my senses and was able to understand that I was just not training myself enough on the new worlds of technologies and domains. That realization (credits of which actually go to 'evolution' of Modern C++ itself) filled me with lot of energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                Another realization I had was every person is different and we can only try to fit ourselves in multiple shoes, but there are few roles that we are actually born for. With that, I left being a techno-managerial role and went onto setting myself as Technologist.
                </p>
                <p>
                Last few years have been deep in Modern C++, and I'm loving the way has shaped up (and shaping) itself. Simultaneously I'm studying for Web Technologies and creating applications, small <a href="projects.html">projects</a>.
                </p>
                I'm fond of Javascript, Web2Py and its amazing how different frameworks have grown to build today's and future's IT solutions.
                <p>
                I suppose I have learnt a few lessons which I would like to share, so I take interest in <a href="trainings.html">Trainings</a>, writing <a href="articles.html">Articles</a> and <a href="youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube Channel</a>.
                <br />
                I've A LOT to learn! and happy that I'm getting to learn.
