        I believe 'Humanity is above all isms'. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India" target="_blank">Constitution of India</a> provides us with access to  Justice, Equality, Fraternity, Freedom. It also provides us with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_Rights,_Directive_Principles_and_Fundamental_Duties_of_India#Fundamental_Duties" target="_blank">Fundamental Rights and Duties.</a>

        Some of my works in social field started from 2004, when I was in Wipro, few of us started Donation activities, and we donated Food, Cloths to a few Orphan houses. We called it "Helping Hands".

        Realized with the wider need of social service I started sharing my technical understanding with few of the local organizations.

        <p>
        Soon I realized the local organizations themselves needed to organize in better manner, and one of the immediate areas to work in is employment. Believed that, if youngsters from Weaker sections of the society are employeed they will be able to treat the entire communities from inside.

        So we started conducting technical sessions, conducting Career guidance camps in slums, and on request-basis we presented them with information. We started a Job portal where without any fees we allowed them access to current jobs in IT and other sectors.

            We founded 'People's Education and Welfare Society' (PEWS) and running above mentioned educational activities under it. The listing of latest works are captured <a href="https://pewscomms.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">here at PEWS Wordpress link</a>.

            Culture is a steering wheel of the masses. We tried to suggest them with philosophies that we felt are most noble and progressive. We created  <a href="http://abplatform.blogspot.com/2016/09/navayan-arts-gallary.html" target="_blank">Navayan Arts Gallary</a> to propogate messages of great leaders.
