          Society of Autonomous Vehicles identifies 6 levels:
        <ul>
          <li>level-0: Driver controls the vehicle. The steering, the throttle, break and all other controls of the
            vehicle.</li>
          <li>level-1: Driver Assistance Level. Driver must be fully engaged. Vehicle supports driver for either
            Steering or
            Acceleration. e.g. cruise control.</li>
          <li>level-2: Partial Automation. Vehicle does few functions automatically, but driver still must be engaged.
            e.g. Automatic Cruise Control, Automatic Lane Keeping</li>
          <li>level-3: Conditional Automation. Vehicle drives autonomously, but Driver MUST take over whenever
            necessary.</li>
          <li>level-4: High Automation - No human interference. May not have steering wheel, break, throttle. Vehicle
            controls all functions autonomously but within
            certain Geofence.</li>
          <li>level-5: Full Automation. Anywhere and everywhere in drivable area.</li>

      <header>ROS (Robotic Operating System)</header>
      <div>
        <p>
          https://www.ros.org/ is not a operating system, but actually is a
          middleware. It is a collection of many libraries, tools. It enables
          collaborative style of software development. They say
          <strong>ROS = Plumbing + Tools + Capabilities + Ecosystem.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>By design ROS is distributed and moduler.</p>
        <p>ROS comprises of majorly 3 parts:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>(1) Communication infrastructure</dt>
          <dd>- Publish/Scribe anonymous mesage passing</dd>

      <div>
        <p>AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture (AUTOSAR) is developed by <i>automobile manufacturers and vendors,
            suppliers, service providers and companies from automotive electronics, semiconductor and software</i>
          together
          in order to standardize the development of vehicle software. Before AUTOSAR every manufacturer and vendors
          used to create their own version of software and its features, interfaces were not compatible with each other.
          With standardization of the architecture and the interfaces each vendor, manufacturer can develop, integrate
          the sub-systems, and build on top of each others works without much thinking of compatibility. Modifications,
          upgrade and update becomes easy. It targets increased reuse and exchangibility of SW modules between OEMs and
          suppliers.
        </p>
        <p>Before AUTOSAR, traditional approach,
          <code>
          <br>[- Application Software -]
          <br>[------- Software -------]
          <br>[------- Hardware -------]
        </code>
        <p>After AUTOSAR
          <code>
            <br>[--- Application Software --]
            <br>[- Standardized Middleware -]
            <br>[-- Standardized Basic SW --]
            <br>[---- Hardware Specific ----]
            <br>[-------- Hardware ---------]
          </code>
        <p>Thus benefits,
        <ul>
          <li>HW and SW - widely independent of each other</li>
          <li>Development can be decoupled, so reduced time and costs</li>
          <li>Reuse of SW, enhanced quality and efficiency</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <p>
        accidents occure, injuries to lives of people, damage to physical
        systems, harm to nature, loss of business
      </p>
      <p>Cause, relying on a system that is possibly not safe-system</p>
      <h3>Safety</h3>
      <p>
        Risks are always there. but Safety is Absence of unreasonable risk.
      </p>
      <h3>Vocabulary</h3>
      <p>Harm: injury, damage</p>
      <p>Hazard: Potential source of harm</p>
      <p>Hazardous Event: Hazardous situation that result in harm</p>
      <p>
        Risk: Probability + Severity of a potential harm (High/Medium/Low)
      </p>
      <p>Safety: No unacceptable risk.</p>
      <p>Safety Function: Function to keep 'safe state'</p>
      <p>Safe State: operating mode without unreasonable level of risk</p>
      <p>
        Safety Integrity: Integrity level that safety function would perform
      </p>
      <h3>Reliability Vs Safety</h3>
      <p>
        Reliable: Doesn't fail in certain timespan, May lead to hazard if
        fails
      </p>
      <p>
        Safe System: May fail in certain timespan, but still be in safe state.
        Do NOT result in (1) Injury to inside and out outside persons (2)
        Least damage
      </p>
      <h3>Active Safety Vs Passive Safety</h3>
      <p>Active Safety: Continuously checks for safety</p>
      <p>Passive Safety: Waits for external trigger to check safety</p>
      <h3>Security Vs Safety</h3>
      <p>Secure need not be safe.</p>
      <p>
        Secure will give protection against attack but cannot guarantee
        Safety. e.g. If accident cause breathing impossible, then even if it
        is Secure from attack, it is NOT safe.
      </p>
      <h3>Faults</h3>
      <p>Random: Mainly due to Hardware failure</p>
      <p>
        Systematic: Mainly, Design flaws, Can be found during verification
        stage
      </p>
      <p>Common: Two or more systems fail because of 1 fault.</p>
      <h3>Safety System</h3>
      <p>Typically: 'fault' --> 'Failure' --> 'Hazard'</p>
      <p>
        Safe: 'Find fault before failure', 'If failure occurs, before hazard
        achieve safe state
      </p>
